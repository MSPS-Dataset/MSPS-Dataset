# MSPS Dataset: Monocrystalline Silicon PV Cell Defects Segmentation Dataset

## Introduction

In collaboration with PV cell production enterprises, this dataset adopts Short-Wave Infrared (SWIR) technology for Electroluminescence (EL) imaging of PV cells to ensure high sensitivity and resolution. This collection, derived from actual production environments of PV cells, is vital for understanding and improving the quality and performance of solar technology.

## Methodology

### Data Collection
- **Environment**: Actual production settings of monocrystalline silicon PV cells.


### Dataset Composition
- **MSPS Dataset**: Contains 1,500 representative images of monocrystalline silicon PV cell defects.
- **Resolution**: Each image is 640 x 590 pixels.
- **Defect Types**: Includes busbar breaks, black spots, cracks, and more, with a focus on challenging characteristics like minute size, multi-scale, and low contrast.
- **Allocation**:
  - **Training Images**: 1,000
  - **Testing Images**: 500
  - Ensures a diverse distribution of defects and challenges.
- **Annotation**: Each image is independently annotated by two experts, with a third expert resolving any discrepancies.

## Objectives

The MSPS dataset aims to provide a comprehensive, specific, and balanced collection of monocrystalline silicon PV cell defects. It emphasizes both quantity and quality to ensure a diverse and balanced resource that is reliable and efficient for defect segmentation research.

## Usage

Researchers and industry professionals can use this dataset to:
- Understand common and challenging defect types in PV cells.
- Enhance the comprehensiveness of PV cell defect detection models.
- Improve the performance and quality assessment techniques for PV cells.

## Availability

The MSPS dataset will be made publicly available upon the acceptance of our accompanying research paper. We believe that the peer-reviewed publication will provide the necessary context and validation for the dataset, ensuring that it is used appropriately and effectively in the research community.
